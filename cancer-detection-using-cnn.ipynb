The data for this competition is a slightly modified version of the PatchCamelyon (PCam) benchmark dataset (the original PCam dataset contains duplicate images due to its probabilistic sampling, however, the version presented on Kaggle does not contain duplicates).\n\n#### Approach:\n\nFor this project, I'm interested in comparing the performance of the pre-trained models VGG-16 and EfficientNet and a custom model which consists of 4 sets of 5 convolution layers on the given dataset. This custom model is based on VGG, only with more convolution layers compared to the 16 convolution layers in VGG-16 or even the newer VGG-19. I will use the RMSProp optimizer for all of them and then compare the output for the one with the best accuracy with Adam optimizer.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport os\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.image import imread\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, Activation, Flatten, Dropout, BatchNormalization\nfrom keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D\nfrom keras import regularizers, optimizers\nfrom keras.layers import PReLU\nfrom keras.initializers import Constant\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\n# for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n#     for filename in filenames:\n#         print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-13T16:43:24.991765Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-13T16:43:24.992458Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-13T16:43:25.003069Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-13T16:43:24.992418Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-13T16:43:25.001844Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The images in this dataset are 96 x 96 px in size and have been pre-divided into training and test data sets. \nInput shape is (96, 96, 3) since these are RGB images with the depth = 3 signifying the three channels for the color.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Step 1: Input Verification\n\nIn this problem we are building a model which detects the presence of cancer in a given sample, it is a binary classification task.\nIf it were just text data, we could have gone ahead with logistic regression algorithm or similar.
